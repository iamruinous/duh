# Simple Planning
Version 1.2.0

Effective planning happens along three time horizons: [short](#short-horizon), [medium](#medium-horizon), and [long](#long-horizon). The time scale is relative to the level of planning that is being done. Planning a portfolio of projects is a different scale than planning an individual product or project. There is some overlap amongst the horizons, however each one has distinct properties. Each horizon also has a corresponding artifact that is beneficial for all the other horizons.

While there is some overlap in the planning horizons, self-organizing teams will typically handle the Medium and Short Horizon planning and report to stakeholders and management. Stakeholders and management are generally responsible for handling Long Horizon planning and incorporating feedback from the Short and Medium horizons during the product development process.

## Short Horizon
Generating [actionable items](#user-content-actionable-items) from the [shared vision](#user-content-shared-vision).

Artifact: [Task List](#user-content-task-list), helps team members know what to work on.

## Medium Horizon
Generating [shared vision](#user-content-shared-vision) from the [clearly defined goals](#user-content-clearly-defined-goals).

Artifact: [Roadmap](#user-content-roadmap), helps guide the Short Horizon and provides an information radiator to others outside the planning process.

## Long Horizon
Generating [clearly defined goals](#user-content-clearly-defined-goals) from [fuzzy ideals](#user-content-fuzzy-ideals).

Artifact: Project Overview, helps constrain the infinite possibilities and sets expectations.

## Glossary

<a name="actionable-items"></a>**Actionable Items**–Work that can be performed by a team member. May be broken down into smaller units, but should be something that contributes in part, or in whole, to the clearly defined goals.

<a name="clearly-defined-goals"></a>**Clearly Defined Goals**–Defines how success is to be measured. Ideally should be be expressed as a pass/fail.

<a name="estimated-completion-date"></a>**Estimated Completion Date**–An estimate of when all "In Development" and "Planned" features from the Roadmap will be completed.

<a name="fuzzy-ideals"></a>**Fuzzy Ideals**–Things that the organization needs to accomplish to be successful.

<a name="roadmap"></a>**Roadmap**–A rough plan that outlines what is in development and planned for the Medium Horizon. Should contain a description of the end state, an [Estimated Completion Date](#user-content-estimated-completion-date), a list of feature names grouped by "In Development", "Planned", and "Unplanned". The Roadmap shows to others inside and outside the project that you have thought through the major features and can articulate what the result of the project will be. As items move to "In Development", they should be completed in one development cycle. If they are larger than that, break the feature down into smaller parts.

<a name="shared-vision"></a>**Shared Vision**–A common understanding of what is being created. A simple description or rough sketch of the project that should be repeatable and reproducible by the members of the team.

<a name="tasklist"></a>**Task List**–A list of Actionable Items.
